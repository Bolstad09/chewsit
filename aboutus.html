    <div id="abouthead3"> One of my greatest weaknesses is being indecisive. With the vast amounts of great restaraunts around the Seattle area, how can you possibly choose one? With the creation of Chews It, I don't have to worry about spending hours on end trying to chews a restaurant to eat at! But what will I wear to the restaurant...?

          <p class="us">I was drawn to Koah’s project because it capitalizes on the tech industry’s desire to simplify everyday activities.
            Koah’s idea is an elegant solution to take the struggle out of choosing what you would like eat everyday whenever
            you need it. With no more than 2 clicks after initial sign up and sign in actions you can have preferred food
            delivered to your door or reservations made. I think it’s a great move forward to connecting people to what they
            want more often without hindrance and I’m excited to see and be a part of the evolution of Chewsit.</p>

          <p class="us">I was drawn to the idea of this app because I have found myself in the exact situation that our app aims to address.
            "Where do you want to eat? I don't know where do you want to go?Hey I know, let's just eat at the same place
            we always go to. Ok." Now I can use my own app that I helped to create and enjoy a great meal and a great restaurant
            filtered through my own personal preferences.</p>

          <p class="us">When I heard Khoa's vision of having an application that would choose our food for us, based on our preferences, I was bowled over! I thought it was such an essential tool as many people such as myself are often confused about where to go for a meal. This led me to join this amazing team and there has been no looking back since then!</p>
